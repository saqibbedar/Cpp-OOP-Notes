/*

In C++, the explicit keyword is used in constructors to prevent implicit conversions of constructor parameters. When a constructor is declared as explicit, it means that the constructor can only be used for direct initialization and not for implicit conversions.

For example, let's consider a simple class called TestClass with a constructor that takes an integer parameter:

class TestClass {
public:
    TestClass(int value) : m_value(value) {}
private:
    int m_value;
};

If the constructor is not declared as explicit, the following implicit conversion is allowed:

int num = 10;
TestClass obj = num; // Implicit conversion of integer to TestClass object 

However, if we make the constructor explicit like this:

class TestClass {
public:
    explicit TestClass(int value) : m_value(value) {}
private:
    int m_value;
};

Now, the above implicit conversion is not allowed. You would need to explicitly create a TestClass object like this:

int num = 10;
TestClass obj(num); // Explicit creation of TestClass object

This helps in preventing unintended conversions and makes the code more clear and less error-prone.

In summary, explicit in C++ is used to prevent implicit conversions by specifying that a constructor cannot be used for implicit conversions. It enforces explicit initialization of objects, improving code readability and safety.
